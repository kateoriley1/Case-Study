## SUMMARY
More than Salad is a vegan food delivery service. For every meal purchased, a healthy vegan meal is donated to a homeless shelter or food bank. The food is local, fresh, and delivered right to the customerâ€™s doorstep. Customers sign up for a subscription that allows them to receive four meals every week. They can skip a week at any time by simply not selecting meals for that week. Customers can choose from a list of eight delicious fully vegan options that vary each week.
